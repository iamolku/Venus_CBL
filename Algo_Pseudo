What happens in each case?

Block detected
-> Size Determined (Infra sensor)
-> Move closer to determine color
-> Communicate with the server - which areas around are unmapped?
    -> In the case that right or left is undiscovered, turn accordingly, and proceed as usual (explore function)
    -> else 
          -> Must go around
          -> e.g. turn right move certain dist forward depending on size of block/grid (applies to next 2 moves as well to make sure robot half-circumnavigates the block
          -> turn left
          -> turn left 
          -> turn left one more time (Check if the block is still there, so it has successfully moved post the block
