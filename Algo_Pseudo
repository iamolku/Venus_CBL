What happens in each case?
Basic Movement
->Explore function (based on explored/unexplored)


Going around
    -> e.g. turn right move distance x forward depending on size of block/grid (applies to next 2 moves as well to make sure robot half-circumnavigates the block
    -> turn left & move forward distance 2x
    -> turn left & move forward x
    -> turn left one more time (Check if the block is still there, so it has successfully moved post the block)
    -> turn 180deg and keep exploring

*keep in mind, after every move update orientation*

Block detected
-> Size Determined (Infra sensor)
-> Move closer to determine color
-> Detect
    -> In the case that right or left is undiscovered, turn accordingly, and proceed as usual (explore function)
    -> else 
          -> Must go around
          -> e.g. turn right move certain dist forward depending on size of block/grid (applies to next 2 moves as well to make sure robot half-circumnavigates the block
          -> turn left
          -> turn left 
          -> turn left one more time (Check if the block is still there, so it has successfully moved post the block
          -> turn 180deg and keep exploring
